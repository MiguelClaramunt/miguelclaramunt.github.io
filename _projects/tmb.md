In 2020, I stumbled upon a low-quality picture online of a set of Barcelona metro tickets from the 1980s. The vintage design immediately sparked an idea: I could vectorize the tickets to create a unique wallpaper or perhaps something more.

This small initial impulse led to a deeper dive. I began researching TMB (Barcelona's Metropolitan Transport) multi-trip cards, finding [sites exploring their history](https://www.autobusesbcn.es/misc/cobros.html) and collector photos. At this moment, I realized the reverse side was just as fascinating, featuring period advertisements. I focused on recreating the simpler designs as some of them were quite intricate and challenging to replicate using Adobe Illustrator with my limited skills.

The project culminated in a set of replicas of these metro tickets that served as bookmarks, printed on satin-finish cardstock at a [local print shop](https://www.paperam.net) in Ciutat Vella. Though already familiar with Illustrator, this project pushed me to manage a larger personal endeavor.

Looking ahead, I aim to refine the design files to make color changes easier and to learn more about professional printing concepts, like [bleed](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleed_(printing)>), to make the final product even sharper and more consistent.
