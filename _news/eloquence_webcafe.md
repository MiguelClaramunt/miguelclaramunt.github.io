Participated in [ELOQUENCE Webcafé: "Detecting and Mitigating Bias in AI Systems"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHfP29vU6k4) with Javier García Gilabert. We discussed practical approaches to detect bias, mitigation strategies, evaluation metrics, and operational considerations for deploying fairer models.
