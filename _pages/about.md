Hello! I am Miguel Claramunt (he/him).

I am a [Research Engineer](https://www.bsc.es/claramunt-argote-miguel), currently working at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center's [Language Technologies Unit](https://www.bsc.es/discover-bsc/organisation/research-departments/language-technologies-unit).

I am pursuing a Master's degree in [Intelligent Interactive Systems](https://www.upf.edu/web/iis) at Universitat Pompeu Fabra. 

My primary areas of interest are Natural Language Processing and Algorithmic Fairness. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research on fake news detection using large language models.
